# Examples

1. main: Describes the prerequisites and how to cross-compile into NILinuxRT.
2. CAN_C_API: Shows a CAN loopback example. (Note: The build automatically copies the file to the IP address; please update this as needed.)
3. Build_Veristand_Cpp_Model: Builds a model for NI's HIL software, Veristand.


for example, for the cross compile example:  
```git clone --branch main https://github.com/DavidSamuelssonNI/Examples.git```
